Interpolating between two ﬁxed points in latent space of a VAE trained on MNIST digits. Top sequence is along the straight line, middle is shorter distance as deﬁned by the pull-back metric of the generator, and bottom is according to metric with a logistic regression feature mapping on top of generator. Getting shorter paths between two prescribed generator outputs (digits in this example) allows more objectively comparing the interpolation capabilities of different generative models.
