Forward exploration (top) and inverse design (bottom) of C-shells. The target design surface is either provided directly by the user or created by deploying an initial beam layout. Subsequent design optimization then solves for the planar curved beam shapes such that the deployed linkage best approximates the target surface, while minimizing its total elastic energy. For inverse design, the initial linkage is computed using a novel flattening optimization. The three columns on the right show diï¬€erent views of the same deployed structure in each row. Fabricated prototypes are shown in black.
